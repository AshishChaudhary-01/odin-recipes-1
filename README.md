This is a project to practice basic html. 

Once I complete this project I will bew able to:
  - Use command line to create directory, navigate through them and many other things
  - Use github to create repository and clone it to my local machine and view my project on the web
  - Use git and its basic workflow (add, commit, push, status, log, shortlog)
  
I will be able to use different elements like: 
  -h(h1,h2,...)
  -img
  -p
  -link
  -list (ul,ol), etc
